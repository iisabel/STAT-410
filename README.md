# STAT-410
Final project for the class STAT 410 (Categorical Data Analysis).

For this project, I took data from the National Surveys on Energy and Environment (NSEE). The survey was conducted biannually on questions regarding energy and climate policies. My goal was to see if a survey taker says they believe in climate change for one question, hoe likely are they to answer other questions with that same stance?

I analyzed the data set by:
- Cleaning the data and reformatting it into a long data set.
- Chose to use a gee model to test for marginal homogeneity.
- Within the model, I also included people's age, gender, political views, and education.
