# STAT-410
Final project for the class STAT 410 (Categorical Data Analysis).

For this project, I took data from the National Surveys on Energy and Environment (NSEE). The survey was conducted biannually on questions regarding energy and climate policies. My goal was to see if a survey taker says they believe in climate change for one question, how likely are they to answer other questions with that same stance? I conducted my analysis using a gee model to test for marginal homogeneity.
